# Additional Software
Here's a the list of additional software that you might find useful.

## Groot2
The [Groot2 Behavior Tree IDE](https://www.behaviortree.dev/groot) is designed explicitly for [BehaviorTree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP) and allows creating behavior trees through visual arrangement of building blocks.

## Visual Studio Code Workspace
If you're using Visual Studio Code and you want to benefit from various automated workflows and quality of life improvements while writing and testing software related to PX4 and ROS 2, feel free to use [this workspace template](https://github.com/robin-mueller/px4-ros2-env). Among other things, this workspace provides a script for setting up a simulation and development environment for applications that integrate PX4 with ROS 2. Therefore, it's **recommended to build up on this template if your aiming to incorporate AutoAPMS and create a ROS 2 workspace from scratch**. 

> [!NOTE]
> Refer to the [readme](https://github.com/robin-mueller/px4-ros2-env?tab=readme-ov-file#px4ros2-development-setup) for more information.
