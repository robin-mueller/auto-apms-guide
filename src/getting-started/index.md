# Getting Started

AutoAPMS is intended to be used with [ROS 2](https://www.ros.org/) and can be built and installed using [`colcon`](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/quick-start.html) just like any other ROS 2 package given that the workspace has been properly set up including all [dependencies](./dependencies). Feel encouraged to check out the advantages of using the [recommended VS Code template](./additional-software#visual-studio-code-workspace) for developers which facilitates setting up an AutoAPMS/PX4 development workspace.
