# User Guide for AutoAPMS

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/robin-mueller/auto-apms?label=Release)](https://github.com/robin-mueller/auto-apms/releases)

Welcome developers, engineers and ROS 2 enthusiasts! üéâ

This is the official user guide and documentation for **AutoAPMS**: An *automated action planning and management system* for ROS 2.

AutoAPMS is a **heavily extensible** development framework for **behavior-based ROS 2 applications**. It provides a **highly modular integration of behavior trees**, implements a **powerful execution engine** and offers **convenient CLI tooling** for deploying behaviors with ease.

The intention of this project is to make it significantly more user-friendly and less error prone to develop autonomous robotics with behavior trees. The core packages are written in C++ and a supplementary Python API exposes high-level features for scripting.

You want to know more about the features of this framework and how to get started? Check out the following pages:
