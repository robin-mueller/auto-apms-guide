# Why AutoAPMS?

Why should you use this software and what is it for?

## Use Case

With AutoAPMS you've found a flexible, ROS2-based solution for designing robotic behaviors and creating highly automated missions. It aims to reduce the amount of manual work required when creating mission plans for nominal as well as abnormal operation. Instead, AutoAPMS's modular mission design concept allows for components to be reused effectively and introduces a powerful systematic behavior planning approach based on a high level of abstraction. This software adds a top-level deliberation layer to existing mission control solutions provided by [Nav2](https://nav2.org/) or [PX4](https://px4.io/). These kinds of software stacks commonly provide functionality on the execution level. AutoAPMS, however, is designed to orchestrate the underlying processes from the management level, effectively extending the capabilities and increasing the intelligence of an autonomous system.
