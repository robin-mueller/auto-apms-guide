# AutoAPMS User Guide

> [!NOTE]
> This website is currently under active development, so please be patient. There will be frequent updates in the coming months.

Welcome developers and engineers! ðŸŽ‰

**AutoAPMS** is a user-friendly software framework which enables **resilient robot mission management**. The name is short for Automated Action Planning and Mission Safeguarding. This is the official user guide and documentation for the open-source project.

The framework offers a powerful solution for modeling and executing safe autonomous missions. It is focusing on unmanned aerial systems (UASs) and fuses concepts and interfaces introduced by [PX4 Autopilot](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot) and [BehaviorTree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP) to provide an intuitive and efficient approach for automating missions even in the most complex scenarios. Additionally, AutoAPMS improves the maturity of autonomous robotic systems by protecting them against critical failures due to operational issues or contingencies. Thus, the software makes complex task planning tangible and enables reactive behaviors by implementing well-structured fallback mechanisms.
