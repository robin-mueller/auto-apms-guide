# User Guide and Documentation

Welcome developers and engineers! ðŸŽ‰

This is the user guide and documentation for the *PX4 Behavior* package. This website is currently under active development, so please be patient. There will be frequent updates in the coming months.

## What is PX4 Behavior?

*PX4 Behavior* is a user-friendly software framework that aims to facilitate the process of modeling and executing autonomous missions. It fuses concepts and interfaces introduced by the [PX4 Autopilot](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot) and the [Behaviortree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP) library to offer an intuitive and efficient approach for developing highly automated systems and enable them to perform arbitrarily complex tasks autonomously.
