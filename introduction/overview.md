# User Guide and Documentation

Welcome developers and engineers! ðŸŽ‰

This is the user guide and documentation for all the functionality included by the [AutoAPMS GitHub repository](https://github.com/robin-mueller/auto-apms). This website is currently under active development, so please be patient. There will be frequent updates in the coming months.

## What is AutoAPMS?

AutoAPMS is referring to **Auto**mated **A**ction **P**lanning and **M**ission **S**afeguarding in the context of robotic applications and is a user-friendly software framework that aims to facilitate the process of modeling and executing autonomous missions. The framework is focusing on unmanned aerial systems (UASs) and fuses concepts and interfaces introduced by the [PX4 Autopilot](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot) and the [Behaviortree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP) library to offer an intuitive and efficient approach for developing highly automated missions. They may perform arbitrarily complex tasks while and are being backed up by well-defined fallback mechanisms. Most importantly, AutoAPMS strives to improve the maturity of autonomous robotics by protecting them against critical failures due to operational issues or contingencies.
